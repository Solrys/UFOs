Creating a web page to track and Analyze UFO sightings in Utah

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using javascript, html, and css that is capable of filtering a data set in a clean and concise manner. The filter put on the webpage is able to narrow the data set by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The webpage is successful in completed its intended purposes. Scrolling down the page, the filter is located on the left side of the page. Once located, the user can filter the criteria they would like to see.

Taking a page from X-Files, "The Truth Is Out There". This tittle is meant to invite curiosity and exploration.
